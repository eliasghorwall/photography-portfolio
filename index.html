			<p>
				My name is Elias and I created this portfolio
				during an internship at Atelier Disko in Hamburg.
				The idea was to build something to showcase my
				photographs in a very focused and distraction-free
				manner. Thanks to their great guidance I learned a
				ton of new things along the way about the conceptual
				and technical work that goes into such a project.
				I had a lot of fun and hopefully you enjoy the results.
				If you have any questions feel free to ask.

						This earth is gorgeous, but I feel we sometimes tend

						It doesn’t happen very often, but when it does I always feel the need

						very mysterious to it and it can transforms places completely. It’s magic.
