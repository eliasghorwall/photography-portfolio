				<p>
					My name is Elias and I created this portfolio
					during an internship at Atelier Disko in Hamburg.
					The idea was to build something to showcase my
					photographs in a very focused and distraction-free
					manner. Thanks to their great guidance I learned a
					ton of new things along the way about the conceptual
					and technical work that goes into such a project.
					I had a lot of fun and hopefully you enjoy the results.
					If you have any questions feel free to ask.
